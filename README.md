Description
-----------
Neophyte TMS is a brand new solution to manage, evaluate and assess employees in a company with a lot of mixed functionalities and better perfomance.With this companies can train their newbies with underlying technologies with minimal effort of their senior developers.

In Neophyte-TMS, company is divided into different departments that will contain the ongoing as well as completed projects of the relative department.When a newbie joins a company he/she allocates a department and a project. The entire projects detail is divided into challenges. If some error occurs while doing a challenge, employee can consult to the bugs directory where he can search for the error. If the same error occurred to someone else then the solution will be in the bugs folder otherwise employee can post the problem in the chat system to discuss it with other employees or he can find the solution of the problem himself and upload it in the bugs folder for future help. After completing the challenge, a quiz is conducted. If he gets scores greater than predefined limit, he will get bonus stars for good performance. If the scores less than predefined limit, he has to retake the quiz otherwise he would not go to the next challenge. A schedule meeting is arranged by looking at the free slots in the schedules of senior developers and newbies to make them familiar with each other. The projects trainer can see the progress of the employees also.
